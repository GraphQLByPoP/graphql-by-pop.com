# GraphQL by PoP website

The GraphQL by PoP website uses [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), a minimalistic [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)-powered static site generator.

## Install

Make sure you have VuePress' requirements:

- Node 8.6+
- Yarn

Clone this repo and install all the dependencies by running:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/getpop/graphql-by-pop.com
$ cd graphql-by-pop.com
$ yarn install
```

## Development

To start the VuePress development server, execute:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

The server will compile the files, enable hot reloading, and indicate the URL of the site:

```bash
> VuePress dev server listening at http://localhost:8080/
```
