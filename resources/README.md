<!-- ### CMS-agnosticism design

Strategy used to make GraphQL by PoP be CMS-agnostic (the article is based on abstracting WordPress code):

1. [Abstracting WordPress Code To Reuse With Other CMSs: Concepts (Part 1)](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/11/abstracting-wordpress-code-cms-concepts/)
2. [Abstracting WordPress Code To Reuse With Other CMSs: Implementation (Part 2)](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/11/abstracting-wordpress-code-reuse-with-other-cms-implementation/) -->
