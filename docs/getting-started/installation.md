# Installation

To date, only the adapters for WordPress have been implemented.

## Requirements

GraphQL by PoP requires PHP 7.1 or higher.

## Installing on WordPress

### By WordPress plugin

_Coming soon..._

### Manual process, via Composer

Please make sure to have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed, and create file `composer.json` in your project. Then complete the following steps.

1. Make sure your `composer.json` file has the configuration below to accept minimum stability `"dev"`:

```json
{
    ...
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "prefer-stable": true,
    ...
}
```

2. Add the following packages to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "getpop/engine-wp": "dev-master",
        "getpop/postmeta-wp": "dev-master",
        "getpop/posts-api": "dev-master",
        "getpop/pages-wp": "dev-master",
        "getpop/usermeta-wp": "dev-master",
        "getpop/commentmeta-wp": "dev-master",
        "getpop/taxonomyquery-wp": "dev-master",
        "getpop/postmedia-wp": "dev-master",
        "getpop/graphql": "dev-master",
        "getpop/api-endpoints-for-wp": "dev-master",
        "composer/installers": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

::: details What are these packages?
From owner `"getpop"`, only packages `"getpop/engine-wp"` and `"getpop/graphql"` are mandatory. The other ones are required to load data from posts, pages, users, comments, taxonomies and media, and to set-up the API endpoint permalink.

Package `"composer/installers"` is required to set-up the required mu-plugins.
:::

3. Add the following `"installer-paths"` under the `extra` section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "installer-paths": {
            "wp-content/mu-plugins/{$name}": [
                "type:wordpress-muplugin"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

::: warning
If your mu-plugins are installed under a different folder, please change this configuration accordingly.
:::

4. Download and install the packages in your project:

```bash
composer update
```

5. Install the must-use plugins in your project (this action is not triggered when first downloading the dependencies, so a subsequent `install` is needed):

```bash
composer install
```

6. Add this code to the beginning of file `wp-config.php`:

```php
// Load Composerâ€™s autoloader
require_once (__DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php');
```

7. Flush the re-write rules to enable the API endpoint:

- Log-in to the WordPress admin
- Go to `Settings => Permalinks`
- Click on the "Save Changes" button (no need to modify any input)

8. Check that the GraphQL API works by executing a query against endpoint `/api/graphql`. Assuming that your site is installed under `http://localhost`, execute in terminal:

```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{ "query": "{ posts { title } }" }' \
  http://localhost/api/graphql/
```

9. Celebrate ðŸ¥³

#### Optionals

1. To accept external API queries, add the snippet below in file `.htaccess`:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
# Enable the server to accept external API queries
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "OPTIONS, GET, POST"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "origin, content-type"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
</IfModule>
```

2. Improve performance: Set-up the API endpoint through the `.htaccess` file

Instead of adding dependency `"getpop/api-endpoints-for-wp"`, you can set-up the API endpoint `/api/graphql` by adding the following code in the root `.htaccess` file (before the WordPress rewrite code, which starts with `# BEGIN WordPress`):

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
# Rewrite from api/graphql/ to /?scheme=api&datastructure=graphql
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^api/graphql/?$ /?scheme=api&datastructure=graphql [L,P,QSA]
</IfModule>
```

### Scaffold a new WordPress site with the API installed, via Composer
