# Installing on WordPress

## By WordPress plugin

_Coming soon..._

## Manual process, via Composer

Please make sure to have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed, and file `composer.json` in the root of your project. If you do not have this file, run this command to create it:

```bash
composer init -n
```

Then complete the following steps.

1. Make sure your `composer.json` file has the entries below to accept minimum stability `"dev"`:

```json
{
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "prefer-stable": true
}
```

2. Add the following packages to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "getpop/engine-wp": "dev-master",
        "getpop/postmeta-wp": "dev-master",
        "getpop/pages-wp": "dev-master",
        "getpop/usermeta-wp": "dev-master",
        "getpop/commentmeta-wp": "dev-master",
        "getpop/taxonomyquery-wp": "dev-master",
        "getpop/postmedia-wp": "dev-master",
        "getpop/graphql": "dev-master",
        "getpop/api-endpoints-for-wp": "dev-master",
        "composer/installers": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

::: details What are these packages?
From owner `"getpop"`, only packages `"getpop/engine-wp"` and `"getpop/graphql"` are mandatory. The other ones are required to load data from posts, pages, users, comments, taxonomies and media, and to set-up the API endpoint permalink.

Package `"composer/installers"` is required to set-up some required must-use plugins.
:::

::: details Can install from tagged releases?
We are currently creating a release for all the required components from the [PoP repo](https://github.com/getpop), and this task will take several days. Until then, components must be installed using the `"dev-master"` version.

Please notice that the README file from unreleased components may temporarily have the `build` badge showing `error`, and the `code quality` badge showing `project not found`. Their code is, however, working well; the problem comes from PSR-2 and static analysis rules executed by [Travis](https://travis-ci.com) not yet satisfied, and the component's project not yet set-up in [Scrutinizer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com). We are fixing these issues component by component, as we release them.
:::

3. Add the following `"installer-paths"` under the `extra` section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "installer-paths": {
            "wp-content/mu-plugins/{$name}": [
                "type:wordpress-muplugin"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

::: warning
If your mu-plugins are installed under a different folder, please change this configuration accordingly.
:::

4. Download and install the packages in your project:

```bash
composer update
```

::: warning
After this step, there should be file a `mu-require.php` under the `wp-content/mu-plugins` folder. If for some reason it is not there, run `composer update` again.
:::

5. Add this code to the beginning of file `wp-config.php`:

```php
// Load Composer‚Äôs autoloader
require_once (__DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php');
```

6. Flush the re-write rules to enable the API endpoint:

- Log-in to the WordPress admin
- Go to `Settings => Permalinks`
- Click on the "Save Changes" button (no need to modify any input)

7. Check that the GraphQL API works by executing a query against endpoint `/api/graphql`. Assuming that your site is installed under `http://localhost`, execute in terminal:

```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{ "query": "{ posts { title } }" }' \
  http://localhost/api/graphql/
```

The (formatted) response should be something like this:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "posts": [
            {
                "title":"Hello world!"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Optionals

1. To accept external API queries, add the snippet below in file `.htaccess`:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
# Enable the server to accept external API queries
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "OPTIONS, GET, POST"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "origin, content-type"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
</IfModule>
```

2. Set-up the API endpoint through the `.htaccess` file

Instead of defining the API endpoint by code through dependency `"getpop/api-endpoints-for-wp"`, it can also be set-up with a rewrite rule in the `.htaccess` file. For this, remove that dependency from composer, and add the code below before the WordPress rewrite section (which starts with `# BEGIN WordPress`):

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
# Rewrite from api/graphql/ to /?scheme=api&datastructure=graphql
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^api/graphql/?$ /?scheme=api&datastructure=graphql [L,P,QSA]
</IfModule>
```
