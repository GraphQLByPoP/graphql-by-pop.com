The new GraphQL by PoP website is now online! It is not fully ready though, since I must still complete the content in all the pages, which I will do during these upcoming days and weeks.

In the meantime, you can check the repos with the code:

- [GraphQL](https://github.com/getpop/graphql)
- [Extended GraphQL](https://github.com/getpop/api-graphql)

And you can check these slides, which give a full overview of the features in GraphQL by PoP:
